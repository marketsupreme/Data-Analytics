Use the [GaussianNB](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html#gaussian-naive-bayes) to train using the `df_melb`dataframe and test using the `df_test` dataframe. Remember to split `df_melb` into a `df_X` with the numerical attributes, and a `s_y` with the target column. On the `df_melb` frame you will have to fill the empty attributes via imputation since the scikit-learn library can not handle missing values.
